The folder empath-client isn't necessary for running the code.
The only thing you need to do before execute the py code is run 'pip install empath' or other methods to install empath package.
Then run ./realTimeEmpathExtraction.py 

Note: If you decide to use file (as noted in python code), please remember to take the empathClass.txt with you.
